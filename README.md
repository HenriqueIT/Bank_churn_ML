# Churn Probability Calculator App

This application is running on **Render**: https://bank-churn-ml.onrender.com

## Context

- **Project context:** I wanted to work on a real **Data Science** project in order to deepen my understanding of commonly used DS libraries such as mlflow, sklearn and FastAPI. 

- **Business context:** My manager identified that the companyÂ´s **churn rate** was roughly **20%** and asked me to **propose measures** to help reduce this percentage.

## Goal

- **Project goal:** Become familar with libraries often used in a DS project (sklearn, mlflow, Fastapi) and gain practical experience by applying them.

- **Business goal:** Develop **ideas** to reduce the churn rate and **propose measures**.

## Structure and flow

This project consists of 5 main steps:

- **Preprocessing / EDA**: Import, clean and visualize the data using pandas and matplotlib to get patterns and insights. 

- **Modelling**: Build and train machine learning models using scikit-learn and optimize the workflow with mlflow.

- **Application**: Develop a user-friendly app that allows users to predict the churn probability for:
    - **One specific client**: manually input client data (predict_single page) 
    - **Multiple clients**: Upload a csv file containing the required columns (predict_batch page). Users can download the .csv file containing the churn probability.

- **API**: Create a simple API that returns the churn probability based on the input data.

- **Deployment**: Deploy the Streamlit application for easy access and use.

## Results

- The model using **Random Forest Classifier** was selected as the most appropriate in this case based on 3 reasons:
    - There were **no signs of overfitting or underfitting** and it has a good generalization performance.
    - The **accuracy, F1 score and the Area under the ROC curve** was the **highest** amongst the models used.
    - The percentage of **False Negative** and **False Positive** were **lower** than other models (on the right size in the image):
        - 46% classified as True Negative
        - 49% classified as True Positive
        - 1,1% classified as False Negative
        - 4,4% classified as False Positive

## Analysis

- Before we think about measures to take so as to reduce the churn rate, I broke this problem into small parts:

    ![small_problems](./assets/images/churn_actions.JPG)

    - **Scenario 1:** The clients which have **low likelihood of churn** are not a problem here because the goal is to come up with ideas to reduce churn.

    - **Scenario 2:** The clients which have **high likelihood of churn and are not profitable** have limited impact on the revenue of the company. For this reason, we considered ok here.

    - **Scenario 3:** The clients which have **high likelihood of churn and are profitable** have a huge financial impact on the company.

    - The table might look like:

        |  | Profitable customer | Non-profitable customer |
        | -------- | -------- | -------- |
        | **High prob. churn** | **Need actions !** | ok !| 
        | **Low prob. churn** | ok ! | ok ! | 

    
    -  The **criterion** for **likelihood** and **profitable** varies for each company and should be evaluated carefully with your manager.

- Measures that can be taken for scenario 3:
